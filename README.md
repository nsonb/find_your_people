 This is a React/Typescript project which was instantiated with [vite](https://vite.dev/).

 To install:

 ```
npm install
```

To run, this should start the application on http://localhost:5173:

```
npm run dev
```

This application uses [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). To run the test in headless mode, first have the application started on local host, then in a new console run:
```
npx cypress run
```

To view and debug the test when cypress runs:
```
npx cypress opens
```
